# simple-processor
The processor of a computer is usually divided into at least four components, the control unit which performs the fetching the signals, the bus which controls access to the data and address bus, latches for temporary storage, and the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logical operations. In this project we will focus on developing all the four components working concurrently.In this project we will use VHDL to implement an ALU with eight functions.
